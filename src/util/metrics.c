/*
 * Metrics Helper
 *
 * The metrics object is used to compute the min/max/avg/std deviation of samples of
 * CPU time, in fixed size and without memory allocations.
 *
 * The values of min/max/avg are meant to be read out of the struct directly, whereas
 * the standard deviation can only be accessed using a helper function (as it is not
 * actually stored directly, but computed on-demand).
 *
 * Only one sample may be active at any point in time, and every sample that is started,
 * must be stopped.
 *
 * See `Note on a Method for Calculating Corrected Sums of Squares and Products' by
 * W. P. Welford, 1962.
